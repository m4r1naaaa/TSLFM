# Terrible File Manager v0.03 (codename arisu)
please actually never use this as the name says it's a terrible file manager (made in p***on ü§Æ) that has horrible code  
the update naming is based on touhou characters and if i ever update it it will probably continue being that
## suwako: initial version
has ls, cd, rm and mk, pretty kewl!!!!!!11 (it sucks please kill me)  
kero kero üê∏
## chiruno: v0.002
added unzipping and that's pretty cool as well  
‚ë®
## arisu: v0.03 and merge with RBTXTE (really bad txt editor)!!!1
today i have gotten the companion of dracobear55 to release TFM+RBTXTE, where i've taken his terrible code and mixed it with my terrible code to create the worst code dedicated to alice margatroid
